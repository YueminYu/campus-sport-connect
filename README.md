### GOAL
Campus Sports Connect aims to bring students at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) together for sports activities by providing a platform to easily coordinate and participate in events. The app allows users to create, discover, and join sports events based on their preferences and availability. By enabling features like user notifications, profile management, and event updates, the platform fosters a more active and connected campus community.
